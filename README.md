# Super-Mario-Mountains
This is a collection of my SMMF3DS courses that I liked

Here is a little description of 3 of them:

# MAIN MAPS:

## Mountainous Mountains:
The first of the series, is a easy level but with a large portion of troll things

## More Mountainous Mountains:
The continuation of the first map, it **WAY MORE HARD** than the first and has more troll things

## Timeless Mountains:
After 2 years, I started to make the continuation, Its harder, even more troller

# SECRET MAPS:

## Demoted Mountains:
Its the Mountainous Mountains but I removed every troll part, being a map more to being funny by the fact that you cannot die

## Underground:
Its a map of a project that I had that was make the most complete and with more details than ever

# Purpouse:

My mission was show how lifefull was Mario Maker 1, principally for 3DS
